# Object-Detection-on-videos-using-Keras
#### Objective was to develop a YOLOv3 model for object detection on videos in Keras.
I used a pre-trained YOLOv3 model weights to perform object localization and detection on new videos. These were trained using the DarkNet code base on the MSCOCO dataset.
The link to download the pre-trained YOLOv3 model weights - https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights.
### Here are the sample screenshots taken from the processed video.
